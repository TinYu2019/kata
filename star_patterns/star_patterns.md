### Steps
1. define size you want to print, define the string;
2. start with the left side, from top to buttom
3. first, think of printing the first row, = printing the columns (use inner for-loop)
4. then think of printing the other rows (use outer for-loop)

```
for(let i=0; i<n; i++){
}

for(let i=1; i<=n; i++){
}
