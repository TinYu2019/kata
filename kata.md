## Data Structure
- the format/way to store data

## Time complexity
- O(1): directly get the target
    - new Set(): has 

- O(n): loop over each number to get the target
    - Array: includes();

## Algorithm
- use appropriate Data Structure to solve a problem(we have famous algorithm for common problems)

## Design Patterns
- connection between Class in a proper way
